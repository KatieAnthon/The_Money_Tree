# The Money Tree
The Money tree is a mobile application that allows users to see  and optimise their spending habits.

The app is designed for users to log in and upload a bank statement to the interface. The app breaks down their spend into the categories that they are spending in and tells them if they have reached their saving goal for the month.

## Design

For ease of developing an app that's functional across both ios and android, I decided to build the frontend utilising React Native (expo) and utlised Tailwind (NativeWind) for UI design. 

## Structure

Frontend is using React Native, using Type-Based structure: 
* Components - contains all the files for reusabable components
* pages - contains different pages of the App.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
1. Install NPM packages:
   `npm install`
   `npm install expo`
3. Enter your IP address in config.js
  `const IP = 'ENTER YOUR IP'`;

## Running the app
To see this running in expo from your phone:
`cd frontend`
`npm start`
